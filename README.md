## <a name="aboutme"> About Me</a> 
<p align="justify"> I am a Entry-Level Software Tester with strong attention to detail. Before I started testing, I learned how important is to be meticulous and a team player through my current experience. I like new challenges, that made me want to learn more and more about this domain and improve my skills every day. My objective is to excel in a challenging and innovative Quality Assurance work environment and aim to exercise my full potential.
